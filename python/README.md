## INSTALLATION ##

- Pip vs Conda
  - pip is default package manager for python
  - conda handles a lot of dependencies for you + easily creation of environments + focussed around DS  
  -
1. Install directly or using a distributor like conda
2. Conda etc. will create the root environment for python with e.g. python 3.8
3. Can then install other python packages within this root environment 
4. Later can add as many python environments with different python version and different packages within each environment  

Virtual Environments?
  - Handles dependencies 
  - Can ensure your app will work on a client computer 
  - Helps colleagues collaborate 


Useful design patterns in python:
- Factory pattern
- Decorator Pattern (e.g. @property,@classmethod,@staticmethod)
- The Building pattern
