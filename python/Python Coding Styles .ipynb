    "\n",
    "- Process of subdividing a computer program into separate sub-programs.\n",
    "- A module is a separate software component. \n",
    "- Similar functions are grouped in the same unit of programming code and separate functions are developed as separate units of code so that the code can be reused by other applications.\n",
    "- OOP is compatible with the modular programming concept to a large extent\n",
    "- Enforce logical boundaries between components and improve maintainability. \n",
    "- Designed to minimize dependencies between different modules. Teams can develop modules separately and do not require knowledge of all modules in the system.\n",
    "- Each and every modular application has a version number associated with it. This provides developers flexibility in module maintenance. If any changes have to be applied to a module, only the affected subroutines have to be changed. This makes the program easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main module and many auxiliary modules. \n",
    "- The main module is compiled as an executable (EXE), which calls the auxiliary module functions. \n",
    "- Auxiliary modules exist as separate executable files, which load when the main EXE runs. Each module has a unique name assigned in the PROGRAM statement. Function names across modules should be unique for easy access if functions used by the main module must be exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits: \n",
    "- Less code has to be written.\n",
    "- A single procedure can be developed for reuse, eliminating the need to retype the code many times.\n",
    "- The code is stored across multiple files.\n",
    "- Code is short, simple and easy to understand."
