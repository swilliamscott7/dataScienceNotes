    "1. What do we want the output of the BTO model to be?\n",
    "    a) Deterministic BTO Value\n",
    "        - Overestimates the predictive ability of the model\n",
    "        - Does not appreciate customer accepting of a range of offers\n",
    "    b) BTO Range based on quantile assignment\n",
    "        - current preference\n",
    "2. Downgrade Propensity\n",
    "    - can we use the current values produced by existing models in production?\n",
    "        - models predict call likelihood and do not factor offer given on the call - leakage of sorts \n",
    "        - we want DG propensity given they have called and given a specific offer amt (essentially what RCT includes)\n",
    "        - how well calibrated are DGs across different product models\n",
    "        - n.b. looked into individual models and cannot tweak single feature input to account for suggested offer\n",
    "            - HD model has features like current tv offer amt, current contract tv offer amt, current HD offer amt, even things like days_until tv offer end which is msot important in most will have to be re-imputed for accurately calibrated propensity etc. Cannot expect to impute new values for all of these and recalculate DG propensity .....\n",

    "            - https://confluence.bskyb.com/display/BusInt/Final+Model+-+Kids+Downgrade\n",
    "    - Is it feasible to create our own models for this based on RCT?\n",
    "        - i.e. recalibrates DG proba in response to offer_amt suggested\n",
    "        - Heavily simplified model with ~10 predictors \n",
    "        - Might at least give us a steer on how important offer_amt_other is vs offer_amt_product based on feature importance plots\n",
    "3. Meet with Richard to discuss further needs/additional unconsidered constraints/get guidance? \n",
    "4. Business level constraints (i.e. part B) rather than just customer level constraints\n",

    "    - Cohort approach, where similiar cohorts given same offers\n",
    "        - How to define cohort? \n",

    "# Outstanding Questions\n",
    "1. Can we better understand the offers we allocate? \n",

    "    - If Cinema offer is monthly whereas Sports is 18 month, this will of course matter to the customer and to our NC expectation\n",
    "2. Can we scope out further constraints? \n",
    "    - what if existing offers on products \n",
    "        - e.g. if £x on Sports already then cannot give £7<\n",
    "    - can we apply offers where in-contract, existing offers"

    "- Is the total offer amount most important OR is the distribution of offers most important ?? Whichever view you take could determine method chosen\n",
    "- The following all assume that we can use DG propensity as a perfectly fine way to choose between products:\n",
    "1. Optimise (MIP) distance from BTO target & best offer allocation (i.e. assumes output of regression model is single deterministic value)\n",
    "    - assumes total offer amount most important factor\n",
    "2. Optimise (MIP) for best offer allocation s.t constraint that total offer amount must be between BTO_low and BTO_high\n",
    "    - added flexibility that considers offer amount as important but appreciates BTO model estimation has limited accuracy & customer willingness to accept is non-deterministic\n",
    "    - emphasis instead on spreading of offers where potential risk to specific products\n",
    "    - understands some customers have strong preference to remove single products\n",
    "3. CP Optimisation to get feasible subsets between BTO_low and BTO_high before externally choosing offer combo with max allocation score\n",
    "    - same rationale as 2.\n",
    "    - potentially just quicker?? \n",
    "    - does not require an objective function\n",
    "    - might not have enough constraints to reduce this down to a small enough subset .. \n",
