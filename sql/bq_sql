DISK SPACE CHEAP - PROCESSING TIME EXPENSIVE 
IN BQ = Data held in fewer, wider tables.More repetition (repeated columns across different tables to avoid joins). Data held as columns.Nested data, faster processing
- We do not need primary index - in fact unique ID's are discouraged 
- No Indexing!  We have partitions and clusters
- You cannot alter, rename or delete fields in the table via SQL


IN RELATIONAL DB = Data broken up into separate tables. One to Many relationships. Data held as rows. Little repetition, saves space 

DML best avoided with BQ as not a relational DB - BETTER TO RECREATE TABLE FROM SCRATCH THAN ALTER OR INSERT
regex functions much faster than like '%__%'
avoid cross joins on huge datasets/cartesian products 
denormalise data (wide tables i.e. counterintuitive to relational DBs)
Add Partitions & Clusters - This will speed up searches of time based data
Use Nested Structures- Use arrays and structs to nest more granular data 

### SHARDING ## Stacks tables with a sequential suffix that can be used in a WHERE clause
# SHARDING IS OKAY BUT PARTITIONING BETTER I.E. SINGLE TABLE PARTITIONED BY E.G. A DATE COLUMN
SELECT  year
       ,AVG(ROUND((max-32)*5/9,1)) AS Avg_celsius
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
  WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '1980'  AND '2010'


## SCRIPTING COMMMANDS E.G #

DECLARE var_name INT64;
SET var_name = 50;

### SAMPLING ###
RAND() vs FARM_FINGERPRINT to achieve repeated random sampling 

unpack array using the UNNEST(array_col) function
nested and repeated fields like ARRAYS which need to broken apart into separate rows in your dataset. This is accomplished by using the UNNEST() function
SPLIT(content, ‘\n’) # splits cell content by newline into array
An array is still essentially one row, just broken down into multiple lines
REGEXP_CONTAINS(colname, r’[\t]’,1,0)
REGEXP_EXTRACT(path_col, r’\.([^\.]*$’)
To get table metadata:
SELECT *, size_bytes/pow(10,9) as size_gb, timestamp_millis(creation_time) as creation_time_readable FROM `project.Campaign_Evaluation.__TABLES__` 
SELECT * FROM `project.Campaign_Evaluation.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` WHERE table_name = ‘metadata’ AND is_partitioning_column = ‘YES’ OR clustering_ordinal_position IS NOT NULL;
